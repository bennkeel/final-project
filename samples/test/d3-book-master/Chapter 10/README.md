Chapter 10: Striking Out on Your Own
==========

Mike Bostock has blessed the world of D3 users with a profusion of examples for how to use the library. He's even created his own way to putting those examples on display â€“ an interface for github gists that renders the output of the code and shows the code itself all on the same page. It's called a block.

__How to find blocks:__

1. If you're looking for a specific chart form, [browse the examples](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
2. If you want to learn how to use a specific method in D3, search for it on [bl.ocksplorer](http://bl.ocksplorer.org/)

__How to make blocks:__

1. Read [this tutorial](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/)

Sometimes you'll get stuck when you're trying to make something and you won't be able to get unstuck by just looking at other people's example code. When this happens, try searching message boards. As of writing, Stack Overflow has almost [10,000 threads](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/d3.js) dedicated to answering questions about D3; the [D3 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3-js) is very active, too.
