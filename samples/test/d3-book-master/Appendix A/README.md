Appendix A: JavaScript for Beginners
==========

This Appendix only covers the most basic of the basic. For a more complete introduction to JavaScript, try reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke. The book is available online in its entirety, with an interactive JavaScript console that let's you code as you go.

For a more advanced take on how to use JavaScript well, check out Douglas Crockford's classic, [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb)
