##Tools

__A text editor__

Good text editors will save you a bunch of time and make coding a real joy. My editor of choice is Sublime Text (and I'm definitely not alone in that preference). Lifehacker did a [reader poll of favorite text editors](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-text-editors-1564907215) recently (more recently than the [tutorializezine story](http://tutorialzine.com/2012/07/battle-of-the-tools-which-is-the-best-code-editor/) I mention in the textbook) if you're text editor shopping.

__A modern browser...__

D3 is built to work with web standards, so to use it, you need a browser that is built to work with web standards â€” a so-called "modern browser." Safari and Internet Explorer 9 are both modern browsers. Here are some free ones:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)

__...with developer tools__

All of the above browsers have built-in developer tools (including a web inspetor and JavaScript console).

__Python__

Whenever you're using D3 with an external data file, it helps to have Python install on your machine so that you can create a local server. If you're using a Mac, Python is already install. Otherwise, you can [install it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
