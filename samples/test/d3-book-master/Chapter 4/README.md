Chapter 4: Shaping Web Pages with D3 Selections
==========

##Files

Name | Description
---|---------
`starter-snippet.html` | A basic HTML file that defines CSS rules in the header, runs the D3 library, and sets aside space to run at D3 at the end of the HTML `body` tag. Good for making bl.ocks.
`selections.html` | The HTML/SVG code used for playing around with selections in this chapter
`selections2.html` | A recreation of `selections.html` entirely in D3 (using selections).
`pop2010-D3.html` | The example bar chart (of the world's age distribution in 2010), created using D3 selections

##More Information

For more information on how selections are implemented in D3, see Mike Bostock's tutorial [How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/). It's an excellent tutorial, though an intermediate one that covers data-joins — it will help if you at least read Chapter 5 before attempting to go through it.

Also, this chapter mentions CSS selectors. For the longest time, I always thought of selectors as being fairly simple — tags like `div`, ids like `#myId`, and classes like `.myClass`. But there are so many other ways to hone in on things in CSS — check out [this crazy document](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/).
