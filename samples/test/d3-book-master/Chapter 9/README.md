Chapter 9: Adding a Play Button
==========

##Files

Name | Description
---|---------
`index.html` | The index file that creates the example bar chart in D3 by grabbing data from an external data file â€” includes buttons to navigate to each year in the data set, plus a play button that cycles through all of the years.
`allData.csv` | An external data file containing all of the age distribution data in comma-seperated values format

##More Information
