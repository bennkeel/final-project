Chapter 8: Making Charts Interactive and Animated
==========

##Files

Name | Description
---|---------
`index.html` | The index file that creates the example bar chart in D3 by grabbing data from an external data file — includes buttons for each year in the data set, and tells the chart to animated to the relevant values when each of the buttons is clicked
`allData.csv` | An external data file containing all of the age distribution data in comma-seperated values format

##More Information

The buttons in this example are terribly designed. In fact, they aren't desinged at all. But that's okay — our main mission here is to learn D3 and perhaps a bit of information design, but not basic web design.

That said, here is a good [overview of some design principles](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/principles-for-successful-button-design--webdesign-6094) you should keep in mind when designing buttons (many of those design principles aren't really that relevant to the kinds of buttons in our population bar chart, but still, it's good food for thought).
