SVG is a web standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium. You can read everything you would ever want to know about SVG [in tremendous detail](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) on the consortium's site.

In the textbook, I mention that SVG paths are defined using a syntax that is like a language unto itself. This is true, and I find that I often return to the [documentation on SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html) to remind myself of how that syntax works.
